## Overview
This is the GitHub repository for the RoboJackets Winter 2020 PCB Competition and the template for individual or team entries into the competition. This repository will also serve to serve as the place for any rules clarifications via the [FAQ](CONTEST.md#faq).

## Rules and Submission

To participate, click the green **Use this template** button. Then give your repository a name and make it **public**. You are now ready to start working! Your submission link will be a link to this new repository you made.

## Example
